Given the flexibility of magic, its users have essentially unlimited possibilities for what to do.
Energy Manipulation	User can create, shape and manipulate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy energy], one of the basic quantitative properties describing a physical system or object's state. It can be transformed (converted) among a number of forms that may each manifest and be measurable in differing ways. The law of conservation of energy states that the (total) energy of a system can increase or decrease only by transferring it in or out of the system, thus the total energy of a system can be calculated by simple addition when it is composed of multiple non-interacting parts or has multiple distinct forms of energy.
Smoke Manipulation	User can create, shape and manipulate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke smoke], collection of airborne solid and liquid particulates and gases emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass. It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires, with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_inhalation smoke inhalation] being the primary cause of death in victims of indoor fires. The smoke kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation caused by carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other combustion products.
Thermal Manipulation	User can create, shape and manipulate [[Wikipedia:Temperature|temperature]], a form of kinetic energy between particles at the atomic or molecular level: the greater the movement of these particles, the greater the thermal energy and reversed. Heat itself is internal thermal energy that flows from one body of matter to another, it is not the same as the energy contained in a systemâthat is, the internal thermal energy of the system. Rather than being &quot;energy-in-residence,&quot; heat is &quot;energy-in-transit.&quot;
Portal Creation	User can open a hole in the universe connecting two non adjacent locations. This may be done in a very neat manner, such as connecting two doorways in the universe, or it may be done very sloppily like breaking a rift in the space time continuum. They may use [[Dimensional Manipulation]] to tear a tiny hole through two universes, use [[Spatial Manipulation]] to overlap two points in the universe or open a black hole or a worm hole connecting those two points.

Kinetic Charging	Users can take the potential energy stored in an object and convert it to kinetic energy thus âchargingâ that item with explosive or disruptive results. The only real limitation to this ability is the time required to charge the object, the larger it is the more time it takes. With practice a user can moderate the amount of power [[Explosion Manipulation|discharged]] upon release as well as duration before the blast making detonation of said object timed or spontaneous. 
Heat Vision	User is able to release/generate immense amount of heat from their eyes, which can be used to burn, heat, melt, weld, etc, targets. Masters of this power may turn it into/gain [[Incineration]] (or vice versa) which is a very similar power.
Enigma Force	Enigma Forces manipulate a particular being to their own desires. It is essentially a sentient power that chooses a host, maybe an energy or a being which controls another energy or being. Attributed powers and singled-out power levels vary from chosen partner and appear to be ambient, presumably adapting to meet the demands of an area's point of devastation and the peril oneself is faced with. However some Enigma Forces have preset abilities that do not depend on the host. Some Enigma Forces becomes in-tune with the partner and drastically enhances the individual host's powers and abilities if they are present; the host themselves may already have reached massive levels of force and energy without the Enigma Force, which only serves to enhance their capabilities even further. Other Enigma forces provide an appropriate set of powers to every host, though the magnitude of the powers may or may not vary.
Gliding	Users can [[Wikipedia:Gliding_flight|glide]], i.e. sail through air without being able to apply thrust and thus have no ability to extend their flight over certain ratio of descending or gaining height by themselves.

Pulse Manipulation	User can create, shape and manipulate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(physics) pulse], a disturbance or one of a series of such transient disturbances that moves through a medium (gas, liquid, solid or energy) from one point to the next point. Exact results depend from the medium, strength/frequency of the pulse, whether the medium is fixed in space or free to move at its end and if the pulse moves from one medium to other.
Kinetic Energy Absorption	The user can absorb kinetic energy, while removing it from the source, into their body and use it in various ways, gaining some form of advantage, either by enhancing themselves, gaining the drained power, using it as power source etc., either temporarily or permanently.

Some of these objects are sentient and have a mind and will of their own and can even take full possession of their host's mind and body if the host is in grave danger, or when the host is angered or enraged. These sentient artifacts/objects can even speak ''through'' their host when it takes full control over the host's body and mind. Most items are accompanied by [[Powers Via Object]].
Cartoon Physics	The user gains the ability to re-write the strict laws of physics in their universe to their convenience and is allowed to overwrite the laws with more lenient and much more absurd physics. May also grant the user [[Immortality]], [[Teleportation]], [[Dream Manipulation]], [[Flight]], [[Creation]], [[Animation]], and seemingly limitless [[Absolute Strength|strength]]. Some high level users may have [[Dimensional Travel]], [[Nigh Omnipotence]], or [[Video Game Mechanics]].
Glass Manipulation	User can create, shape and manipulate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass glass], an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid material that exhibits a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_transition glass transition], which is the reversible transition in amorphous materials (or in amorphous regions within semicrystalline materials) from a hard and relatively brittle state into a molten or rubber-like state.
Energy Perception	User can perceive energies that binds the universe together, allowing them to perceive destiny/causality, which can be used to avoid life courses, follow a trail, or [[precognition|view the future]]. Often viewed as points and lines some users are only able to see large collections of energy, like a powerful person or place. Some lines may connect two people together, or a person to a place, some points may have no lines at all. User may be able to use this method to tie a persons destiny to a single point causing them to die instantaneously even if they had magical or armor protection, perhaps even preventing [[Reanimation]].

Absorption Kiss	The user is able to drain the life force of other beings through lip contact.
Ancestral Paradox Defiance	The user is able to exist even when history is changed: for example, if someone were to go back in time and kill the user's ancestors, the user exists still as if their ancestors' murder did not happen at all. If they were killed by someone in the past via time travel, they will still be alive in the present. Normally this will cause others user knows to completely forget about them like they did not exist before, though sometimes the user can make it so that a few people, or even everyone they know would still know who they are as if they do exist.
Sacrificial Protection	User can give their lives to shield others from harm, be it a life-threatening disease or injury or an apocalyptic force or event.Â This can be done either by using a specialized ability or ritual that will inevitably kill the user or by overusing one's natural capabilities until the strain on their bodies becomes fatal.Â  Death can occur immediately after the power is activated or at some later point, and the protection offered can either be defensive in nature (i.e. a protective charm/barrier that prevents harm or teleporting those the user wants to protect to another location) or offensive in nature (i.e. unleashing immense power/energy to seal or obliterate a dangerous entity).Â The duration of the protection can either be momentary, ending shortly after the user has died, or can last for much longer periods of time, possibly even for all eternity.Â 
Life Connection	User is connected to any/all life and living things, so that as long as they exists life does as well. This allows them to have both an emotional and spiritual link to every form of life, so if the target feels pain or is injured all living things would feel the same pain and/or possibly gain the same wounds as the user.
Organic Preservation	User can preserve any organic substance, whether living or dead, and keep them fresh and keep them from rotting and decomposing.

Personality Sharing	User can share their personality with others, allowing them to grant the same focus and desire to other people that they have. This grants them a unique symbiosis with others since they have the same personality they can do anything that requires steady focus without any hesitation since the user and target both know what to do without having to explain to each other.
Undetermined Existence	User exists in an undefined/undetermined state, meaning that they don't fit into the standard mold or categories/classifications of existing beings. As such they cannot be truly considered to be living or dead and amortal or undead, instead they exist in an undefined grey area both inside and outside of the standard categories of existing creatures.

Property Linking	User can link the properties of anything, allowing them to connect the properties of object so that whatever properties one item has so does the other (if one object is made of ceramic then so now is the other one). This also links what happens to the objects, so if one object is cracked or broken the other one will also break or crack as that that crack is considered a property and the reverse works as well so if one object is fixed so will the linked one.
Unsupported Motion	The user can move and attack normally, even when their body is loose and unsupported, for example not having bones to support one's body/is much like jelly. User can still move and attack, even if affected by something such as [[Rigidity Removal]] that would normally take away their ability to stand or move.

They are intelligent, can converse in human tongues and walk on two legs, making no sound as it moves.
Temporal Isolation	User can isolate themselves or others from most temporal effects while still existing inside of the timestream. The power is like a big stone in a river, the water being the flow of time and the stone being a part of the river while also isolated from most of its effects, the water must pass by the stone while it just sits there and ignores the waters effects. this works under the same basic concept. This allows them to ignore temporal effects such as [[Temporal Rewind|rewinding]], [[Time Reduction|reduction]], [[Time Acceleration|acceleration]], and even [[Age Shifting|shifting]].
Self-Exertion	The user can exert a force on oneself instead of pushing off another surface, literally &quot;pulling on their bootstraps&quot;. By Newton's Third Law, it would be impossible to exert a force on oneself just to move around. To move, one would need to touch another object and push or pull on it in order to cause movement. User does not have to worry about that, they can knock themselves down by slapping their head, lift themselves by pulling their hair, dodge by pushing their hip, move by extending and moving one's arm in a direction, etc. This may extend to other objects the user is holding onto.

The soul grants them some of the powers of such an entity, being able to use their magic and causing madness and fear in those around them.
Psionic Magic	Users, by some means, have both psionic and magic powers at the same time. These powers are tied within the user, mixing the two aspects together and creating something truly unique, powerful, and versatile. Perhaps, through the study of arcane truths, the users have unlocked the powers of the mind. Perhaps through astral projection and other such aspects, the user somehow gained magical power. Either way, users of this power are truly a force to be reckoned with.
Remote Motion Manipulation	User can move anything/everything at any distance just by moving their limbs (arms/hands/fingers/feet/legs/head/eyes/etc.), allowing them to control anything as if their limbs were physically attached/connected to everything around them.

Event Rearrangement	The user is able to delay or make events come sooner. Here is how it works. When making events come sooner, the user practically moves the desired event that has yet to happen back in time. The moved event and all that follows will be &quot;on top&quot; of the events that are happening now and the events before the moved event happens. Both the moved and other event actually happen at the point in the timeline, so they are both remembered, but the events before the moved event will be &quot;skipped&quot;, and though they still happen, they are not observed and visibly happen (though there are still recordings, footage and memories of those events) in favored to the events that have been made to come sooner. Time is also cut short when the event is moved.
Axis Manipulation	The user can manipulate the three [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis axis of rotation], the imaginary line a body rotates along, and can be external (like a planet around the sun) and internal (like a ball spinning), usually among the object or person's center of gravity.
