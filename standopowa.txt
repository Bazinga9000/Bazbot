The rate and amount of healing varies widely (see ''[[#Levels of Regeneration|Levels of Regeneration]]''); some can regrow missing limbs, others must put the limb back in place for rapid regeneration. They are generally in very good physical shape as their bodies are constantly reverting to healthy state, granting them nigh-inexhaustible stamina and vitality.
Adoptive Muscle Memory	The user can copy any movement/action after seeing it performed once, including acrobatics, martial arts, and other physical stunts. With these skills they can become masters and incredible at what they do, by combining what several forms and movements in rhythmic motions instead of using the same thing over.
Body Part Substitution	The user can replace parts of their body with same organs from outside sources, gaining the powers they'd had before the connecting, such as an eye with night vision would give the ability to see in the dark, a hand taken from a plasma blaster could allow them to fire plasma blasts from that hand.

Users can also assimilate the knowledge, skills, memories and special abilities of their victims and share them with all replicas, becoming exponentially more powerful with each upgrade.
Animation	The user can give a life to inanimate objects/substances, animating them to act/move on their own accord out of the user’s control; however, they do seem to work in tandem to their animator.
Disintegration	Users cause targets (whether organic or inorganic material) to lose cohesion in various means. Some can make matter fall apart, wipe away their target on a molecular/sub-molecular level or even revert matter into pure energy. Regardless of the means, the target is reduced to either molecular/sub-molecular dust or energy but not absolutely annihilated.
Melting	User can liquefy objects/organisms by causing the molecules merge together and thus lose total physical cohesion. Viscosity depends on the object being liquified, if it has a high water content then the object could become completely water like liquid. If the object is rock like or inorganic, then it will become a thick and mud-like liquid, while metal would become like mercury.

Given the flexibility of magic, its users have essentially unlimited possibilities for what to do.
Energy Manipulation	User can create, shape and manipulate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy energy], one of the basic quantitative properties describing a physical system or object's state. It can be transformed (converted) among a number of forms that may each manifest and be measurable in differing ways. The law of conservation of energy states that the (total) energy of a system can increase or decrease only by transferring it in or out of the system, thus the total energy of a system can be calculated by simple addition when it is composed of multiple non-interacting parts or has multiple distinct forms of energy.
Smoke Manipulation	User can create, shape and manipulate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke smoke], collection of airborne solid and liquid particulates and gases emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass. It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires, with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_inhalation smoke inhalation] being the primary cause of death in victims of indoor fires. The smoke kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation caused by carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other combustion products.
Thermal Manipulation	User can create, shape and manipulate [[Wikipedia:Temperature|temperature]], a form of kinetic energy between particles at the atomic or molecular level: the greater the movement of these particles, the greater the thermal energy and reversed. Heat itself is internal thermal energy that flows from one body of matter to another, it is not the same as the energy contained in a system—that is, the internal thermal energy of the system. Rather than being &quot;energy-in-residence,&quot; heat is &quot;energy-in-transit.&quot;
Portal Creation	User can open a hole in the universe connecting two non adjacent locations. This may be done in a very neat manner, such as connecting two doorways in the universe, or it may be done very sloppily like breaking a rift in the space time continuum. They may use [[Dimensional Manipulation]] to tear a tiny hole through two universes, use [[Spatial Manipulation]] to overlap two points in the universe or open a black hole or a worm hole connecting those two points.
Life-Force Constructs	Users can turn life-force energy into tools, objects, weapons and other items, create semi-living constructs and/or create structures/buildings of varying permanence. Users who have mastered this ability can use it for almost any situation, creating anything they need.

This specialize mutation may cause the physical appearance, genetic code and mentality of the victim to be drastically altered forcing them to become monster-like.
Invocation	User can gain control over the targets (living or unliving) by using names or phrases to manipulate a person or the universe itself, their words provides them with control over who and what they desire to manipulate.
Kinetic Charging	Users can take the potential energy stored in an object and convert it to kinetic energy thus “charging” that item with explosive or disruptive results. The only real limitation to this ability is the time required to charge the object, the larger it is the more time it takes. With practice a user can moderate the amount of power [[Explosion Manipulation|discharged]] upon release as well as duration before the blast making detonation of said object timed or spontaneous. 
Heat Vision	User is able to release/generate immense amount of heat from their eyes, which can be used to burn, heat, melt, weld, etc, targets. Masters of this power may turn it into/gain [[Incineration]] (or vice versa) which is a very similar power.
Enigma Force	Enigma Forces manipulate a particular being to their own desires. It is essentially a sentient power that chooses a host, maybe an energy or a being which controls another energy or being. Attributed powers and singled-out power levels vary from chosen partner and appear to be ambient, presumably adapting to meet the demands of an area's point of devastation and the peril oneself is faced with. However some Enigma Forces have preset abilities that do not depend on the host. Some Enigma Forces becomes in-tune with the partner and drastically enhances the individual host's powers and abilities if they are present; the host themselves may already have reached massive levels of force and energy without the Enigma Force, which only serves to enhance their capabilities even further. Other Enigma forces provide an appropriate set of powers to every host, though the magnitude of the powers may or may not vary.
Gliding	Users can [[Wikipedia:Gliding_flight|glide]], i.e. sail through air without being able to apply thrust and thus have no ability to extend their flight over certain ratio of descending or gaining height by themselves.

They can enhance, reduce or remove them temporarily or permanently, protect them from being overwhelmed, cause the target to sense things that aren't there or prevent them from sensing things that are, cause/remove sensory ailments, etc.
Pulse Manipulation	User can create, shape and manipulate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(physics) pulse], a disturbance or one of a series of such transient disturbances that moves through a medium (gas, liquid, solid or energy) from one point to the next point. Exact results depend from the medium, strength/frequency of the pulse, whether the medium is fixed in space or free to move at its end and if the pulse moves from one medium to other.
Kinetic Energy Absorption	The user can absorb kinetic energy, while removing it from the source, into their body and use it in various ways, gaining some form of advantage, either by enhancing themselves, gaining the drained power, using it as power source etc., either temporarily or permanently.
Enhanced Endurance	Users can operate on a ''low power setting'', allowing them to operate for an extended amount of time. They can hold their breath for longer periods of time and remain calm through stressful or painful situations, tolerate extreme hunger, unbearable thirst, and strong urges to sleep.

Powerful Objects	Some immensely strong and powerful '''Objects''' that can grant numerous and untold power to the wielder. Some of these objects are sentient and have a mind and will of their own and can even take full possession of their host's mind and body if the host is in grave danger, or when the host is angered or enraged. These sentient artifacts/objects can even speak ''through'' their host when it takes full control over the host's body and mind. Most items are accompanied by [[Powers Via Object]].
Cartoon Physics	The user gains the ability to re-write the strict laws of physics in their universe to their convenience and is allowed to overwrite the laws with more lenient and much more absurd physics. May also grant the user [[Immortality]], [[Teleportation]], [[Dream Manipulation]], [[Flight]], [[Creation]], [[Animation]], and seemingly limitless [[Absolute Strength|strength]]. Some high level users may have [[Dimensional Travel]], [[Nigh Omnipotence]], or [[Video Game Mechanics]].
Glass Manipulation	User can create, shape and manipulate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass glass], an amorphous (non-crystalline) solid material that exhibits a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_transition glass transition], which is the reversible transition in amorphous materials (or in amorphous regions within semicrystalline materials) from a hard and relatively brittle state into a molten or rubber-like state.
Energy Perception	User can perceive energies that binds the universe together, allowing them to perceive destiny/causality, which can be used to avoid life courses, follow a trail, or [[precognition|view the future]]. Often viewed as points and lines some users are only able to see large collections of energy, like a powerful person or place. Some lines may connect two people together, or a person to a place, some points may have no lines at all. User may be able to use this method to tie a persons destiny to a single point causing them to die instantaneously even if they had magical or armor protection, perhaps even preventing [[Reanimation]].
Elemental Breath	The user is able to generate and manipulate elements/energy within them in a way that allows them to shape the exhaling of the effect. These shapes can include bursts, streams, spheres, even a mist of it from the mouth.

The power is like a big stone in a river, the water being the flow of time and the stone being a part of the river while also isolated from most of its effects, the water must pass by the stone while it just sits there and ignores the waters effects. this works under the same basic concept. This allows them to ignore temporal effects such as [[Temporal Rewind|rewinding]], [[Time Reduction|reduction]], [[Time Acceleration|acceleration]], and even [[Age Shifting|shifting]].
Self-Exertion	The user can exert a force on oneself instead of pushing off another surface, literally &quot;pulling on their bootstraps&quot;. By Newton's Third Law, it would be impossible to exert a force on oneself just to move around. To move, one would need to touch another object and push or pull on it in order to cause movement. User does not have to worry about that, they can knock themselves down by slapping their head, lift themselves by pulling their hair, dodge by pushing their hip, move by extending and moving one's arm in a direction, etc. This may extend to other objects the user is holding onto.

Psionic Magic	Users, by some means, have both psionic and magic powers at the same time. These powers are tied within the user, mixing the two aspects together and creating something truly unique, powerful, and versatile.

Either way, users of this power are truly a force to be reckoned with.

When making events come sooner, the user practically moves the desired event that has yet to happen back in time. The moved event and all that follows will be &quot;on top&quot; of the events that are happening now and the events before the moved event happens. Both the moved and other event actually happen at the point in the timeline, so they are both remembered, but the events before the moved event will be &quot;skipped&quot;, and though they still happen, they are not observed and visibly happen (though there are still recordings, footage and memories of those events) in favored to the events that have been made to come sooner. Time is also cut short when the event is moved.

The user still acts, looks, thinks the way they do, as their body and mind are still the same. However, when someone tries to read or duplicate the user, they do not read or duplicate the user, but the person they copied the DNA and mind of earlier. For example, those who read the mind, personality and memories and emotions of the user would find themselves reading the mind of someone else rather than the user.
